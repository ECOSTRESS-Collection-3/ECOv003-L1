# We require all the packages geocal requires (see requirements.txt for that
# package), plus stuff listed in this file.
#
# Note that at least on pistol, tflearn and tensorflow give an illegal
# instruction if we build using wheel. So likely want to use the
# --no-binary :all: to force a local build
cython
xlrd
tflearn
# On pistol, Installed
# all the dependencies
# pip install --no-binary :all: tflearn absl-py astor bleach==1.5.0 gast grpcio html5lib==0.9999999 markdown protobuf werkzeug wheel
# pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-binary :all: numpy
# Note that tensorflow 1.6 has an illegal instruction (see https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/17411). We can work around this by forcing the
# version to use as 1.5.0
#
# For ecostress, we can use the intel built version of this (we'll need to
# test to make sure this works). See https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-optimized-tensorflow-wheel-now-available
# We do this with:
# pip install https://anaconda.org/intel/tensorflow/1.6.0/download/tensorflow-1.6.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
# On pistol, this version has an illegal instruction
#
# Turns out on eco-tb1 this has really terrible peformance, it completely sucks
# up the machine and has really bad performance. Not sure why this is so
# crappy, but looks like we are much better off using tensorflow==1.5.0 ther
# also
tensorflow==1.5.0
