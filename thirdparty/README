Tensorflow pip package unfortunately requires a much never gcc (9.2 I think).
Not clear why they just assume everybody has installed and is using that,
but for ecostress we are using the standard centos 4.8.5 version.

Also, Tensorflow uses the AVX extensions for CPUs. That is generally available,
but older CPUs might not have it. Can search for support with

   cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep avx

This requires us to build our own copy of this library, which we have
make rules for. This doesn't need to be done regularly, we just check the
wheel file we generate in and can use it. But if you need to update (e.g.,
newer version of python), you may need to rebuild this.

Note that this uses "bazel" which is yet another build system (by google).
It apparently changes its API frequently, you need to match the bazel
version to the tensorflow version. See
