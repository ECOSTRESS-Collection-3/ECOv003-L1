We produce a SPICE kernel for the ISS orbit.

To do this, we first started by downloading the Two Line Element (TLE) 
covering 2015 from space-track.org. Note that this contains duplicates,
not sure why.

This data has been downloaded to the file iss_tle.txt.

We then hand created the file iss_spice.txt. Note that this file has
hardcoded paths, so if you need to rerun the spice generation you may need
to edit these file. The paths are for the CartLab computer pistol.

We then create the spice kernel by 

mkspk -setup iss_spice.txt

Where mkspk is a spice program for making a spice kernel.
