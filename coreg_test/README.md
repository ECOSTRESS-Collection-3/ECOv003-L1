An initial test of the coregistration accuracy we can expect was done by
Tom Logan. This is a copy of the TAE PDF files used to for this testing,
so we have a record of this.

This does *not* include the test data, which is substantial in size, just
the steps used to produce that test data. The original PDFs along with the
test data can be found on the CartLab computer pistol at
