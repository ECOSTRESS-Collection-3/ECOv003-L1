Note the commands are in docker/docker.am. We run using make, just for
convenience. If you are experimenting, you can just run the commands directly.

1. First, just set up a normal ecostress build.

   Something like:

   ../../ecostress-level1/configure --prefix=/home/smyth/Local/ecostress-build/install --enable-maintainer-mode --with-afids=/opt/afids --with-geocal=/home/smyth/Local/geocal-build/install --with-test-data=/home/smyth/Local/ecostress-test-data

2. Copy in the afids latest iso (this is too big to include in the ecostress
   git repository).

   pushd ../../ecostress-level1/docker/afids-docker
   cp /data/smyth/afids-repository-centos7/afids-06-12-2020.iso
   popd

3. make afids-image
   This is a centos7 system plus and install of afids
   This builds the image ecostress/afids:1.28

4. make ecostress-dependency-image
    This starts with ecostress/afids and adds ecostress specific dependencies
    This builds the image ecostress/ecostress-dependency:1.0

5. make ecostress-image
    This build ecostress and runs the end to end test

   Note if you need to run this interactivately to debug something, you can
   connect to the container with

   docker exec -it `cat docker_run.id` bash --login
   
   If you need to clean up a failed run, you should do
   
   docker container stop `cat docker_run.id`
   rm docker_run.i
