This contains docker files for building a docker container with
ecostress-level1 in it.

There are build rules for doing this. We have three stages, the idea being
that stage 1 and 2 are much more stable and only occasionally need to be
updated. stage 3 is the actual ecostress-level1, and needs to be updated
when we need a ecostress-level1 update.

1. Stage 1 is ecostress/afids. This contains a centos7 system plus an install
   of afids. This requires the afids install DVD iso - this is available
   from the Cartlab (on pistol). Because of the size, we don't include the
   iso in this git repository. Put the iso in the afids-docker directory
   before building afids-image.
2. Stage 2 is ecostress/ecostress-dependency. This contains stage 1, plus
   all the ecostress dependencies (e.g., the python packages).
3. Stage 3 is ecostress/ecostress-level1. This is the level 1 software, built
   against ecostress/ecostress-dependency.

Sample set of commands:

make afids-image
make create-ecostress-dependency-repo
make ecostress-dependency-image
make ecostress-image
make ecostress-image-end-to-end-check
# make ecostress-image-save - Create a .tar.gz file, not necessary for delivery
# but might be useful
make ecostress-image-deliver
